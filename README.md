## Description

A simple web note app using Node and Express: read, write, edit and delete notes. Each note has a generated unique ID using UUIDv4. Note data persists in a JSON file, which, including routes, are  hosted on a local server using Express.js.

## Installation

Download files or clone repository. Run `npm install` to install dependancies. Run `node app.js` to start the server.

## Usage

Use to create, edit, save and delete notes on a web app where data is stored locally in a JSON file for future use.

## Credits

This app was created by CookingMeister. Starter source code such as static files for index and notes.html, as well as styling and JS, were provided by [edX](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka). W3Schools and MDN Webdocs were referenced for express best practices. Youtube channel [procademy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00NNuZHF56A&list=PL1BztTYDF-QPdTvgsjf8HOwO4ZVl_LhxS&index=38&t=824s) was referenced for delete routes and code refactoring.

## Tests

Testing is done with Jest. In the root directory run `npm test`.
